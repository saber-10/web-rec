# 🔍 XAIQuest: Seeing Beyond Accuracy

Welcome to the **XAIQuest** recruitment challenge!  
Your mission is to **train, evaluate, and interpret** multiple CNN architectures — going beyond just accuracy.  
This task will test your understanding of **model performance, robustness, calibration, and explainability**.

---

## 🧠 Overview

You are required to:
- Train **multiple convolutional neural network (CNN)** architectures on the given image dataset.  
- Evaluate their **performance, calibration, robustness, and interpretability**.  
- Use **explainability methods** such as **Grad-CAM**, **Eigen-CAM**, and **Integrated Gradients** to analyze and compare model behaviors.  
- Design **stress tests** to explore model robustness and uncover **spurious correlations**.
- Present both **quantitative** and **qualitative** analyses.  

Your goal is to **understand not just how well your model performs, but why it performs that way**.

---

## 📚 Dataset
Use **CIFAR-10** as the primary dataset.

Optionally, for robustness experiments, use **CIFAR-10-C**, which includes 19 types of common image corruptions (noise, blur, weather, digital, etc.).

## 🗂️ Task Stages

### **Stage 1 — Model Training & Baseline Evaluation**
**Objective:** Build a strong foundation.

- Implement and train at least **three CNN architectures**:
  - e.g., ResNet, VGG, DenseNet, EfficientNet, Inception, Xception, or custom CNNs.
- Evaluate standard metrics:
  - **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-score**, **ROC-AUC** and **Confusion Matrix**.
- Document training setup (optimizer, learning rate, augmentations, etc.).

📊 **Deliverables:**
- Training logs and results.
- Comparison table of all architectures on standard metrics.

---

### **Stage 2 — Beyond Accuracy: Calibration & Robustness**
**Objective:** Evaluate model confidence and stability.

- Compute **calibration metrics**:
  - Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Reliability Diagrams.
- Assess **robustness under corruptions**:
  - Noise, blur, compression, brightness, or color shifts.
- Plot **accuracy vs corruption intensity**.

📊 **Deliverables:**
- Calibration plots and metrics.
- Robustness curves showing performance degradation.

---

### **Stage 3 — Explainability & Visualization**
**Objective:** Understand *why* models make decisions.

Use **explainability techniques** to analyze your models:
- **Grad-CAM**
- **Eigen-CAM**
- **Integrated Gradients**
- **Others if you find anything interesting**

Perform these analyses for:
- Correctly classified images.
- Misclassified images.

💡 **Compare** the outputs:
- Where do the methods agree or differ?
- Why might those differences arise?

📸 **Deliverables:**
- Side-by-side heatmaps for all three methods.
- Explanatory notes discussing key insights.

---

### **Stage 4 — Stress Testing & Bias Probing**
**Objective:** Evaluate model reliability and uncover hidden weaknesses.

Design **stress tests** to reveal vulnerabilities:
- Add noise or blur to test robustness.
- Insert a small colored pixel/patch for only one class; the model should then latch on to that and use it to classify that class.
- Change image backgrounds or occlude parts of the object.
- Drop or shuffle color channels.
- Compare models trained **with vs without** Mixup/CutMix.
- For all the above, use explainability at different layers of your CNN model and give a report on how edges learned at different layers, as you go deeper, differ across architectures and how they are affected when noise is injected.

📈 **Quantitative Evaluation:**
- Accuracy & per-class F1 under perturbations.
- Calibration and robustness metrics under stress.

🧩 **Qualitative Evaluation:**
- Explainability heatmaps before and after corruption.
- Analysis of how model focus shifts under stress.

---

### **Stage 5 — Comparative Analysis & Report**
**Objective:** Synthesize your findings.

Prepare a concise yet insightful report that includes:
- Comparison of all CNNs on:
  - Accuracy, Calibration, Robustness, Interpretability.
- Key patterns and takeaways from explainability results.
- Strengths and weaknesses of:
  - Grad-CAM
  - Eigen-CAM
  - Integrated Gradients
  - Any other method you have used
- Critical reflections on:
  - What explanations reveal about **bias**, **reliability**, and **generalization**.

📑 **Deliverables:**
- Summary tables & graphs.
- Interpretability visualizations.
- Written analysis (Markdown/PDF/Notebook).

## 🌟 Bonus Stage — Going the Extra Mile

For those who want to **stand out**, here are some advanced challenges:

- 🔄 **Implement your own XAI variant** (e.g., Grad-CAM++, SmoothGrad, or Guided Backprop).
- 🎨 **Build an interactive dashboard** using Gradio or Streamlit to visualize explanations.
- 🧩 **Perform concept-based interpretability** (e.g., testing sensitivity to object textures, colors, or shapes).
- 🧠 **Compare pre-trained vs fine-tuned models** and analyze explainability differences.
- 📚 **Write a short reflection (≤ 1 page)** on what “trustworthy AI” means in your own words, based on your findings.

---

## 🧩 Evaluation Criteria

This challenge is **not about achieving the highest accuracy** — performance metrics are included only to ensure that your models are functional and ready for interpretability analysis.  
The real focus is on **the depth of your experiments**, **the insights you extract**, and **the reasoning you provide** to explain your observations.

### 🔍 Key Focus Areas

- **Interpretability Experiments:**  
  Design and conduct thoughtful experiments using techniques such as Grad-CAM, Eigen-CAM, and Integrated Gradients.  
  Explore how explanations differ across models, layers, and perturbations. Creativity and scientific curiosity are highly valued.

- **Reasoning and Analysis:**  
  Provide clear, logical reasoning for your findings.  
  Explain *why* models behave a certain way, not just *what* they do.  
  Connect your qualitative (visual) and quantitative (metric-based) observations to form well-supported conclusions.

- **Presentation and Structure:**  
  Present your work in a well-organized and readable manner.  
  Maintain a clear directory structure and avoid dumping all files in a single folder.  
  Ensure your reports are detailed yet understandable, including plots, comparisons, and clear justifications for every claim.

- **Code Readability:**  
  Keep your code modular, well-documented, and commented wherever necessary.  
  Others should be able to reproduce and understand your results without confusion.

---

### 🧾 Expectations

- Document **every experiment** carefully
- Maintain a clean, logical folder organization, for example:

## 💡 Tips for Success

- Focus on **clarity** and **interpretability**, not just high accuracy.
- Use **visuals** — heatmaps, reliability plots, corruption graphs.
- Explain *why* something happens, not just *what* happens.
- Keep your code clean and modular.
- Think critically — what does your model truly "see"?

**Good luck! 🚀**
This challenge is designed to test not only your technical ML skills but also your ability to reason about **model behavior, trust, and interpretability** — the core of real-world AI research.
