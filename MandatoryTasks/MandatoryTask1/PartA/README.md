# Creating Word Embeddings

The goal of this task is to experiment and create word embeddings based on the given sentences and the context. 

> The NewsQA Dataset can be used as provided in the references of Task C

For each set of embeddings created, you are expected to create a csv file with (word, embedding) pairs and upload the same in your repository.

Different forms of experimentation and architectural model building are encouranged irrelevant of the performance of the model. Novel Ideation or Smart Experimentaion is highly appreciated.
