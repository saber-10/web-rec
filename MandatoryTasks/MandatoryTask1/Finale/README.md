# TASK 1 FINALE: ANSWERING QUESTIONS IN FRENCH

In this finale task, i've combined the model in Task 1.B and TASK 1.C and made a question answering model which takes input in english and answer's in FRENCH

I couldn't load the previous models properly because of system and files issue, but it works for simpler data.
